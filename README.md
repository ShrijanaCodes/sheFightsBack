# sheFightsBack

sheFightsBack is an android application that aims at helping domestic violance victims with resources that are just one tap away.
I worked on the front-end of this application at SheHacks hackathon in Boston, and my team also won an award for our app. This is still a work in progress.
The repository will be updated as I and my team will be working on it during summer of 2018.
